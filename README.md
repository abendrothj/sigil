## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Easiest - 2 minutes)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abendrothj/basilisk.git
cd basilisk
docker-compose up
```

**That's it!** Visit http://localhost:3000

See [DOCKER_QUICKSTART.md](DOCKER_QUICKSTART.md) for details.

### Option 2: Local Setup (Developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abendrothj/basilisk.git
cd basilisk
chmod +x setup.sh run_api.sh run_web.sh
./setup.sh

# Terminal 1: Start API
./run_api.sh

# Terminal 2: Start Web UI
./run_web.sh
```

Visit http://localhost:3000

### Option 3: CLI Only (No Web UI)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abendrothj/basilisk.git
cd basilisk
./setup.sh
source venv/bin/activate

# Poison single image
python poison-core/poison_cli.py poison my_art.jpg protected_art.jpg

# Robust mode (PGD - survives compression better)
python poison-core/poison_cli.py poison my_art.jpg protected_art.jpg --pgd-steps 5

# Batch process folder
python poison-core/poison_cli.py batch ./my_portfolio/ ./protected/
```

**Output:** Poisoned images + signature files for detection

## 🎯 What Does This Do?

### The Problem
AI companies scrape your artwork/photos from the internet and train models on them **without permission or compensation**. Traditional watermarks don't work because they get averaged away during training.

### The Solution: Radioactive Marking
1. **Inject** a unique, imperceptible "signature" into your image's features
2. **Publish** the poisoned image instead of the original
3. **Detect** if AI models trained on your work by testing for your signature
4. **Prove** data theft with cryptographic evidence

### Real-World Use Cases

- **Artists**: Protect portfolios from Midjourney/Stable Diffusion training scrapes
- **Photographers**: Prevent unauthorized use in image generation models
- **Studios**: Safeguard proprietary concept art and designs
- **VFX Artists**: Protect video content from AI video model training

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Run Test Suite

Comprehensive test coverage (75+ tests, 85%+ coverage):

```bash
./run_tests.sh          # Run all tests
./run_tests.sh coverage # With coverage report
./run_tests.sh unit     # Only unit tests
```

**Test Categories:**
- **Unit Tests** - Core algorithm (`test_radioactive_poison.py`)
- **API Tests** - Flask endpoints (`test_api.py`)
- **CLI Tests** - Command-line interface (`test_cli.py`)

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for full documentation.

### Verify Poison Works (Integration Test)

Test that the poison actually survives model training:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python verification/verify_poison.py
```

This will:
1. Create a mini-dataset (100 clean + 100 poisoned images)
2. Train a small ResNet-18 model
3. Detect your signature in the trained model
4. Output: **Detection confidence score** (should be > 0.1 for poisoned models)

---

## 📋 Usage Examples

### CLI - Single Image

```bash
python poison-core/poison_cli.py poison input.jpg output.jpg --epsilon 0.01
```

### CLI - Batch Processing

```bash
python poison-core/poison_cli.py batch ./my_portfolio/ ./protected/ --epsilon 0.015
```

### CLI - Detection

```bash
python poison-core/poison_cli.py detect trained_model.pth signature.json test_images/
```

### API - cURL

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/poison \
  -F "image=@my_art.jpg" \
  -F "epsilon=0.01" \
  > response.json
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Epsilon (Perturbation Strength)

| Value | Effect | Use Case |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 0.005 | Very subtle, harder to detect | Maximum stealth |
| **0.01** | **Recommended** | **Balance of stealth + robustness** |
| 0.02 | Strong protection | High-value work |
| 0.05 | Maximum protection | May have visible artifacts |

**Rule of thumb:** Start with 0.01. Increase if signature doesn't survive training.

---

## 🔐 Security & Legal

### How Signatures Are Generated

```python
seed = SecureRandom(256 bits)  # Cryptographically secure
signature = SHA256(seed) → 512-dimensional unit vector
```

- **2^256 possible signatures** (impossible to guess)
- **Deterministic** from seed (reproducible proof)
- **Non-repudiable** (you can't fake someone else's signature without their seed)

### Legal Use

✅ **Allowed:**
- Protecting your own creative work
- Academic research on data provenance
- Defensive security testing
- Legal evidence in copyright disputes

❌ **Not Allowed:**
- Poisoning datasets you don't own
- Malicious attacks on public resources
- Evading legitimate research agreements

**See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for full terms.**

## 🖥️ Video Perceptual Hash Robustness (Beta)

### What is this?
This project now includes a robust, compression-resistant perceptual hash for video, designed to survive aggressive H.264 compression (CRF 28) and tested on public benchmarks (UCF101, synthetic, and more).

### Usage

Extract and compare perceptual hashes for a video (see experiments/perceptual_hash.py):

```bash
python experiments/perceptual_hash.py <video_path> [max_frames]
```

Batch test hash robustness before/after compression:

```bash
python experiments/batch_hash_robustness.py test_batch_input 60 28
```

### Results (as of Dec 2025)
- Synthetic and public benchmark videos: Hamming distance after CRF 28 compression is typically 0–14/256 (very robust)
- Pure noise: Higher drift (expected, as noise is not preserved by codecs)

### Reproducibility
- All scripts are in experiments/
- See experiments/README.md for details and how to add your own videos
